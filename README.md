My Leet Code Exercises

Although I have been coding for 33+ years, and I have been doing Java for 20 years (starting with Java 3), I am still expected to do some coding exercices when I have a Technical Screen video call.

99.99999999999999% of my work in the past 15-20 years has been involved with getting data from the UI (or other system), and then put that data into a database.  But, also taking that request from the UI, calling some Business Logic, accessing data from the database, and then sending that back to the UI (or other calling system).     Usually, intense algorithmic business logic is not usually required.    Now, that we have the Internet, Google, and Stack Overflow, whenever I get stuck, I can alwayse use those rresources.

In any event, when doing Technical Screens, I have been asked to write Easy LeetCode questions.

So, I joined LeetCode, and I'm using that to help me write better code.  Not only to understand the algorithms, but help me write the code quicker.

This project is where I am keeping some of my leet code rresults.  It's just a tool because the Leet Code Editor, although not bad, isn't the same as my local Eclipse (Spring Tool Suite or STS).
